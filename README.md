_Bootstrapped with [imba-base-template](https://github.com/imba/imba-base-template)._

Welcome to the Imba base template! Let's get you set up and ready to code!

This codebase has both backend and frontend code, all written in Imba.

If all you need is a simple static website with no server logic, you can check out one of the static hosting templates: 

- Netlify
- Github Pages
- CloudFlare Pages

The files are named `server.imba` and `client.imba` for simplicity. You can call them anything you want, and organize the code any way you like. As long as your `package.json` uses your server file and your `index.html` uses your client file, it will work.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
